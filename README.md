# McDaddy

## Problem

Growing up, I always had trouble picking what to eat. I thought to myself "Why can't I make any decisions, is it because I'm a failure? No! Choices! It is all their fault. There's too many of them, if only I can avoid them like I avoid my responsibilities." With that thought, I came across this awesome programme, McDaddy. McDaddy helps me to solve this problem by scraping the McDonald's menu on UberEats UK and chooses the meal given my low college student budget and other preferences. With McDaddy, I do not have to make such a tough choice in choosing what to eat ever again.

## Solution

McDaddy is a GUI which takes the menu of the website and chooses them based on criterias and decides what to order. lxml library is used to scrape the data using the xpath on the site. The GUI is designed using PySimpleGUI and it is simple and interactive. The design is meant to be simple and straightforward, making it intuitive for other users of the programme.

### Usage:

The link is now limited to UberEats UK McDonald's menu. Please insert the URL appropriate url for it to work. Here's an example link for McDonald's at Waterloo Station. (https://www.ubereats.com/london/food-delivery/mcdonalds-waterloo-station/g96iDW8lSOG0vCg8CrFANA)
